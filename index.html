                            Working time means the time used to work and the time during which the employee is obliged to be available to the employer at the work place. The time spent on commuting between home and workplace is not working
                            time. It can be if itâ€™s considered a work performance.

                            We all want to be productive and make the most out of the time that we have every day. However, focusing too much on making every hour productive can be counterproductive, in fact, leading to lower performance,
                            fatigue, and eventually burnout. We need to rest, and there are good reasons to include free time in your routine to support your health, well-being, and a high level of performance.

                            Everyone loves the weekend. Weekends are a huge topic of conversation. Starting on Wednesday or Thursday, people will ask you about your weekend plans. When you return to work or school, you'll be asked how your
                            weekend went. So it's helpful to have a nice range of phrases to use for these conversations.

                            My studies are quite interesting and sometimes difficult. You have surprises and difficult moments, but when you overcome the test that has come to you on your own, the result is unimaginable. I love my
                            profession
